Webscrapping is being done on JSSTU college result website and Results are fetched and sorted out.

This Code works only on JSSTU website. This is just an idea that One can do Webscrapping on College Website and Fetch the result of all your friends in a minute.

Website Looks Like this :
Entering USN Page : results.jssstuniv.in/  [Which Excepts USN of Student]
Result Page : results.jssstuniv.in/check.php  [Obtained Result ]

Idea Behind this is :
Directly pass the required parameter [i.e USN here] to this URL : results.jssstuniv.in/check.php and GET the result HTML and WebScrap it.


Output : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukqW-WpGkUE
